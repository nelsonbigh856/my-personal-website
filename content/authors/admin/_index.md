Hi! My name is Frankie and I am the Resident Pet at UNSW tending to over 60,000 students as their furry friend on campus. I sleep during the day and roam around at night, although most students leave campus by the time I wake up. Sometimes students offer me food and I gladly accept. I hope to see you on campus!
