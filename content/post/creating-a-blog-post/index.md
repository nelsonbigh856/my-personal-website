The Wowchemy CMS has many features to style your website articles.

## Formatting text

Place emphasis on your text with **bold** or *italic*s.

## Lists

My favourite gelato flavours:

1. Macadamia Crunch
2. Cookies and Cream
3. Rum and Raisin
4. Matcha
5. Coconut and Lychee

Let's make a smoothie!

* Milk
* Honey
* Strawberries
* Blueberries
* Weetbix

## Code

Include `code snippets` in your sentences.

You can also write code blocks with syntax highlighting!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## LaTeX Math

Quadratic formula for $ax^2+bx+c=0$:

$$x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
